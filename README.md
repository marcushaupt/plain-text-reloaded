# Plain Text: Reloaded

This project was inspired by the [plaintextproject](https://plaintextproject.online/articles.html), which will not be updated since December 2022. It was created out of the incentive to give technically minded people a way to create simple and beautiful PDFs from Markdown files.

This project uses [Dendron](https://www.dendron.so), a knowledge management tool for the popular editor [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

## How to use this project efficiently

To use the project efficiently, I recommend installing the knowledge management tool Dendron. For this, I suggest following the [Dendron installation instructions](https://wiki.dendron.so/notes/678c77d9-ef2c-4537-97b5-64556d6337f1/).

After you have installed Dendron, you can create a new workspace and load this GIT repository into the directory of your new workspace.

### Use GIT-submodule to get access to the templates

To make the templates available separately and to develop them independently, I use my own GIT repository. Therefore I recommend to include the repository for the templates via the GIT submodule.
